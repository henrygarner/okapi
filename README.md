# okapi

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

## Usage

### Dependencies

To ensure you're using the latest and greatest Giraph, you need to build the project from source with [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html) and install it to your local Maven repo.

    git clone git://github.com/apache/giraph.git
    cd giraph
    mvn install

We assume that this will install 0.2-SNAPSHOT.

You can then run `lein deps` to include other project dependencies.
